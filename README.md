# stackoverflow-lite

This project aims to build a light-version of stackoverflow page to showcase what I have learned about react framework.

The project is using `jsonserver` as an artificial backend compatible with RESTful-API.

## How to run

You need to install `jsonserver` and run `json-server -w db.json -p 8000` at the `/frontend` directory to get the database up.

You then need to run `npm start` to start the page and then you will see the website. Note that the admin password is `Password1`, which enables you to edit / delete posts / answers / comments.

A quick demo of the website can be found at [https://usc.zoom.us/rec/share/pQX37J89ZtfHrSMNe0IhkEV9sRA6TMkfWoFudyUa9YO6o_mzZd-FBm2cDu86OeaS.F_DDJaEUs5HA1iQd](https://usc.zoom.us/rec/share/pQX37J89ZtfHrSMNe0IhkEV9sRA6TMkfWoFudyUa9YO6o_mzZd-FBm2cDu86OeaS.F_DDJaEUs5HA1iQd)
